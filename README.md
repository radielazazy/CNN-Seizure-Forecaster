****Introduction to Project****

Currently, EEG is primarily used for seizure classification
and not prediction. The project leverages noninvasive
scalp-EEG data to develop a model that can alert
patients and assist medical professionals in predicting
epileptic seizures before they happen. Classification and
forecasting modules were implemented in MATLAB,
including time-frequency maps, statistical modeling,
signal processing, and machine learning. The proposed
design achieves a classification accuracy of
approximately 70% and a forecasting precision of 74.3%
thirty minutes before seizure onset, enhancing patient
quality of life without invasive procedures, medication,
or clinical information.
